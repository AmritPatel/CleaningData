## Dataset Description

There are 5 variables corresponding to 5 different acceleration measurements made for each activity and test subject. For each measurement this dataset contains: (1) the average of several repeated measurements that have been normalized, and (2) the average of the standard deviation of several repeated measurements that have been normalized.

An additional 4 variables are created from 4 of the 5 measurements by transforming the acceleration data to frequency data (by applying a Fourier transform). This creates a total of 9 variables of type (1) described above. There are 9 additional variables that are of type (2) described above.
